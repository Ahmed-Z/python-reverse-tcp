# python-reverse-tcp-shell

To gain control over a target system, a reverse shell is an integral part of a hacking/pentesting process, it enables the attacker to execute system commands on the target machine. This python shell is a robust one, reconnecting to the attacker machine each time the connection is lost and an XOR encryption is implemented to encrypt the traffic sent between the two machines.
